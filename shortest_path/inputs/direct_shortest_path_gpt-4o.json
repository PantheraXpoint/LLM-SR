Let's analyze the graph:\n\n1. Start at node 3.\n2. From node 3, the possible moves are:\n   - To node 2 with weight 3.\n   - To node 4 with weight 1.\n\n3. From node 4, the possible moves are:\n   - To node 0 with weight 1.\n   - To node 1 with weight 1.\n   - To node 2 with weight 3.\n   - To node 3 with weight 1 (but we don't go back).\n\n4. From node 2, the possible moves are:\n   - To node 0 with weight 2.\n   - To node 1 with weight 4.\n   - To node 3 with weight 3 (but we don't go back).\n   - To node 4 with weight 3.\n\nNow, let's calculate the shortest paths:\n\n- Path 1: 3 -> 4 -> 1\n  - 3 to 4 has a weight of 1.\n  - 4 to 1 has a weight of 1.\n  - Total weight = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n- Path 2: 3 -> 2 -> 0 -> 1\n  - 3 to 2 has a weight of 3.\n  - 2 to 0 has a weight of 2.\n  - 0 to 1 has a weight of 4.\n  - Total weight = 3 + 2 + 4 = 9.\n\n- Path 3: 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 1\n  - 3 to 2 has a weight of 3.\n  - 2 to 4 has a weight of 3.\n  - 4 to 1 has a weight of 1.\n  - Total weight = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.\n\nThe shortest path is Path 1 with a total weight of 2. Therefore, the shortest path from node 3 to node 1 is:\n\n{{[3, 4, 1]}}",

The possible paths from node 4 are:\n   - 4 to 2 with weight 3.\n   - 4 to 5 with weight 4.\n\nLet's explore these paths:\n\n- From node 4 to node 2 (weight 3):\n  - From node 2, you can go to:\n    - Node 1 with weight 3 (total weight 6).\n    - Node 5 with weight 2 (total weight 5).\n\n- From node 4 to node 5 (weight 4):\n  - From node 5, you can go to:\n    - Node 0 with weight 1 (total weight 5).\n    - Node 1 with weight 3 (total weight 7).\n    - Node 2 with weight 2 (total weight 6).\n    - Node 3 with weight 3 (total weight 7).\n\nNow, let's find the shortest paths to node 0:\n\n1. Path: 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 0\n   - 4 to 2 (weight 3), 2 to 5 (weight 2), 5 to 0 (weight 1)\n   - Total weight = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6\n\n2. Path: 4 -> 5 -> 0\n   - 4 to 5 (weight 4), 5 to 0 (weight 1)\n   - Total weight = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nThe shortest path from node 4 to node 0 is the one with total weight 5. Therefore, the shortest path is:\n\n{{[4, 5, 0]}}",

We can use Dijkstra's algorithm or any other shortest path algorithm to determine the shortest paths.

From node 12, we need to find the shortest path back to node 1.\n\nBy exploring these paths, we find that the shortest path from node 1 to node 12 is:\n\n- 1 -> 5 -> 9 -> 11 -> 3 -> 12 with a total weight of 2 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 8 = 29.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from node 1 to node 12 is:\n\n{{[1, 5, 9, 11, 3, 12]}}",

From node 14, the possible edges are:\n   - To node 0 with weight 3.\n   - To node 4 with weight 9.\n   - To node 5 with weight 9.\n   - To node 6 with weight 7.\n   - To node 9 with weight 3.\n   - To node 13 with weight 9.\n   - To node 15 with weight 1.\n\n6. From node 12, the possible edges are:\n   - To node 5 with weight 10.\n   - To node 8 with weight 10.\n\nNow, let's find the shortest path from node 2 to node 12:\n\n- One possible path is: 2 -> 15 -> 14 -> 0 -> 9 -> 14 -> 15 -> 6 -> 4 -> 13 -> 11 -> 10 -> 8 -> 12\n- Another possible path is: 2 -> 13 -> 4 -> 6 -> 15 -> 14 -> 0 -> 9 -> 14 -> 15 -> 6 -> 4 -> 13 -> 11 -> 10 -> 8 -> 12\n\nHowever, these paths are not optimal. Let's find the shortest path by considering the minimum weights:\n\n- The shortest path is: 2 -> 13 -> 4 -> 6 -> 14 -> 15 -> 0 -> 9 -> 14 -> 15 -> 6 -> 4 -> 13 -> 11 -> 10 -> 8 -> 12\n\nThe total weight of this path is 7 (2 to 13) + 2 (13 to 4) + 3 (4 to 6) + 7 (6 to 14) + 1 (14 to 15) + 4 (15 to 0) + 3 (0 to 9) + 3 (9 to 14) + 1 (14 to 15) + 8 (15 to 6) + 3 (6 to 4) + 2 (4 to 13) + 8 (13 to 11) + 9 (11 to 10) + 10 (10 to 8) + 10 (8 to 12) = 91.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from node 2 to node 12 is:\n\n{{[2, 13, 4, 6, 14, 15, 0, 9, 14, 15, 6, 4, 13, 11, 10, 8, 12]}}",

Use a priority queue to explore nodes based on the shortest known distance.\n\n2. **Explore Neighbors**: For each node, update the distances to its neighbors if a shorter path is found.\n\n3. **Repeat**: Continue exploring until all nodes have been processed.\n\n4. **Trace Back**: Once the shortest path to node 12 is found, trace back to find all possible paths with the same minimum distance.\n\nGiven the graph's edges and weights, let's find the shortest paths:\n\n- From node 4, the possible paths to node 12 are:\n  - 4 -> 15 -> 12\n  - 4 -> 8 -> 15 -> 12\n\nBoth paths have the same total weight of 14 (4 to 15 is 5, 15 to 12 is 9; 4 to 8 is 8, 8 to 15 is 9, 15 to 12 is 9).\n\nThus, the shortest paths from node 4 to node 12 are:\n\n{{[4, 15, 12], [4, 8, 15, 12]}}",

We can use Dijkstra's algorithm or a similar shortest path algorithm to determine the shortest path(s) based on the edge weights.\n\nLet's outline the steps to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Start at node 9.\n2. Explore all possible paths to node 10, keeping track of the cumulative weights.\n3. Identify the path(s) with the minimum cumulative weight.\n\nGiven the edges and weights, let's find the shortest path(s):\n\n- From node 9, we can go to node 4 with weight 3.\n- From node 4, we can go to node 13 with weight 1 (total weight 4).\n- From node 13, we can go to node 18 with weight 5 (total weight 9).\n- From node 18, we can go to node 5 with weight 5 (total weight 14).\n- From node 5, we can go to node 6 with weight 1 (total weight 15).\n- From node 6, we can go to node 10 with weight 10 (total weight 25).\n\nHowever, this path is not optimal.

Let's analyze the connections:\n\n1. Start at node 12:\n   - Node 12 is connected to node 8 with weight 2.\n   - Node 12 is connected to node 10 with weight 8.\n   - Node 12 is connected to node 17 with weight 9.\n\n2. From node 8:\n   - Node 8 is connected to node 6 with weight 2.\n   - Node 8 is connected to node 3 with weight 6.\n   - Node 8 is connected to node 9 with weight 1.\n   - Node 8 is connected to node 12 with weight 2.\n   - Node 8 is connected to node 14 with weight 2.\n\n3. From node 6:\n   - Node 6 is connected to node 11 with weight 8.\n   - Node 6 is connected to node 8 with weight 2.\n   - Node 6 is connected to node 17 with weight 6.\n   - Node 6 is connected to node 13 with weight 5.\n\n4. From node 11:\n   - Node 11 is connected to node 0 with weight 5.\n   - Node 11 is connected to node 2 with weight 9.\n   - Node 11 is connected to node 6 with weight 8.\n   - Node 11 is connected to node 9 with weight 5.\n\n5. From node 0:\n   - Node 0 is connected to node 4 with weight 7.\n   - Node 0 is connected to node 11 with weight 5.\n\nNow, let's find the shortest path from node 12 to node 4:\n\n- Path 1: 12 -> 8 -> 6 -> 11 -> 0 -> 4\n  - Total weight: 2 (12 to 8) + 2 (8 to 6) + 8 (6 to 11) + 5 (11 to 0) + 7 (0 to 4) = 24\n\n- Path 2: 12 -> 8 -> 9 -> 11 -> 0 -> 4\n  - Total weight: 2 (12 to 8) + 1 (8 to 9) + 5 (9 to 11) + 5 (11 to 0) + 7 (0 to 4) = 20\n\n- Path 3: 12 -> 8 -> 14 -> 3 -> 15 -> 19 -> 2 -> 11 -> 0 -> 4\n  - Total weight: 2 (12 to 8) + 2 (8 to 14) + 8 (14 to 3) + 9 (3 to 15) + 2 (15 to 19) + 8 (19 to 2) + 9 (2 to 11) + 5 (11 to 0) + 7 (0 to 4) = 52\n\nThe shortest path is Path 2 with a total weight of 20. Therefore, the shortest path from node 12 to node 4 is:\n\n{{[12, 8, 9, 11, 0, 4]}}",
