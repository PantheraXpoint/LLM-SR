From node 8, we can go to node 6 (weight 2) and then to node 5 (via node 11, weight 9) or directly to node 5 (not possible).\n3. Therefore, the only path from node 2 to node 5 is through node 8 and then to node 6.\n\nThe path is:\n- 2 → 8 → 6 → 4 → 5\n\nNow, let's calculate the total weight of this path:\n- 2 to 8: 10\n- 8 to 6: 2\n- 6 to 4: 5\n- 4 to 5: 5\n\nTotal weight = 10 + 2 + 5 + 5 = 22.\n\nHowever, we can also check if there are any other paths:\n- From node 2, we cannot reach node 5 directly or through any other nodes without going through node 8.\n\nThus, the only shortest path from node 2 to node 5 is:\n- 2 → 8 → 6 → 4 → 5\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\nA: {{[2,8,6,4,5]}}",

The total weight for this path is 4 + 2 = 6.\n   - Alternatively, from node 3, we can go to node 16 (weight 2) and then from node 16 to node 0 (weight 3), and then from node 0 to node 1 (weight 6). The total weight for this path is 2 + 3 + 6 = 11, which is longer than the previous path.\n   - Another option is to go from node 3 to node 14 (weight 8) and then from node 14 to node 16 (weight 9), and then from node 16 to node 0 (weight 3), and finally from node 0 to node 1 (weight 6).
