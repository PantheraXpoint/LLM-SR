Starting from node 2, we can explore the graph:\n\n1. From node 2, we can go to:\n   - Node 1 (cost 1)\n   - Node 3 (cost 3)\n   - Node 4 (cost 2)\n\n2.

The other paths (2 → 4 → 0 and 2 → 3 → 0) have a total cost of 4, which is longer.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only shortest path from node 2 to node 0 is:\n- {{[2, 1, 0]}}\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n{{[2, 1, 0]}}",

Start from node 1:\n   - Current node: 1, Distance: 0\n   - Neighbors: 5 (4), 3 (1)\n   - Update distances: \n     - Distance to 5 = 4\n     - Distance to 3 = 1\n\n2. Move to node 3 (the closest):\n   - Current node: 3, Distance: 1\n   - Neighbors: 5 (3), 6 (1), 4 (4)\n   - Update distances:\n     - Distance to 5 = 4 (no update)\n     - Distance to 6 = 2 (1 + 1)\n     - Distance to 4 = 5 (1 + 4)\n\n3. Move to node 6 (the closest):\n   - Current node: 6, Distance: 2\n   - Neighbors: 0 (3), 2 (1), 3 (1), 4 (4)\n   - Update distances:\n     - Distance to 0 = 5 (2 + 3)\n     - Distance to 2 = 3 (2 + 1) (update)\n     - Distance to 4 = 6 (2 + 4)\n\n4. Move to node 2 (the closest):\n   - Current node: 2, Distance: 3\n\n### Step 3: Backtrack to Find All Shortest Paths\nThe shortest distance from node 1 to node 2 is 3. Now we need to find all paths that yield this distance:\n\n1. **Path 1**: 1 → 3 → 6 → 2\n   - Distance: 1 (to 3) + 1 (to 6) + 1 (to 2) = 3\n\n2. **Path 2**: 1 → 3 → 2\n   - Distance: 1 (to 3) + 2 (to 2) = 3\n\n3. **Path 3**: 1 → 5 → 2\n   - Distance: 4 (to 5) + 3 (to 2) = 7 (not a shortest path)\n\n4. **Path 4**: 1 → 5 → 3 → 6 → 2\n   - Distance: 4 (to 5) + 3 (to 3) + 1 (to 6) + 1 (to 2) = 9 (not a shortest path)\n\n### Final Result\nThe only valid shortest paths from node 1 to node 2 with a total distance of 3 are:\n\n- Path 1: 1 → 3 → 6 → 2\n- Path 2: 1 → 3 → 2\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n{{[1, 3, 6, 2], [1, 3, 2]}}",

Start from node 4:\n   - Distance to node 1: 3\n   - Distance to node 3: 2\n   - Distance to node 6: 1\n   - Distance to node 5: 3\n\n2. From node 6 (distance 1):\n   - Distance to node 0: 2 (total distance 1 + 2 = 3)\n   - Distance to node 1: 1 (total distance 1 + 1 = 2)\n   - Distance to node 3: 3 (total distance 1 + 3 = 4)\n   - Distance to node 4: 1 (already visited)\n   - Distance to node 5: 1 (already visited)\n\n3. From node 3 (distance 2):\n   - Distance to node 0: 4 (total distance 2 + 4 = 6)\n   - Distance to node 1: 6 (total distance 2 + 4 = 6)\n   - Distance to node 4: 4 (already visited)\n   - Distance to node 6: 5 (already visited)\n\n4. From node 1 (distance 2):\n   - Distance to node 0: 3 (total distance 2 + 1 = 3)\n   - Distance to node 3: 6 (already visited)\n   - Distance to node 4: 5 (already visited)\n   - Distance to node 2: 3 (total distance 2 + 1 = 3)\n   - Distance to node 5: 6 (already visited)\n\n### Step 3: Identify All Shortest Paths\nThe shortest distance from node 4 to node 0 is 3. The paths that yield this distance are:\n\n1. **Path 1**: 4 → 6 → 0\n2. **Path 2**: 4 → 1 → 6 → 0\n3. **Path 3**: 4 → 1 → 2 → 0\n\n### Final Answer\nThus, the possible shortest paths from node 4 to node 0 are:\n\n{{[4, 6, 0], [4, 1, 6, 0], [4, 1, 2, 0]}}",

Start from node 5, the initial distance to itself is 0.\n2. Explore its neighbors (node 2 and node 7) and update their distances.\n3. Continue this process until all nodes are processed.\n\nAfter running Dijkstra's algorithm, we find that the shortest distance from node 5 to node 0 is 6.\n\n### Step 3: Backtrack to Find All Shortest Paths\nNow we need to find all paths that yield this shortest distance of 6. The paths can be traced back from node 0 to node 5 using the recorded predecessors during the Dijkstra's algorithm.\n\nThe possible shortest paths from node 5 to node 0 are:\n\n1. **Path 1**: 5 → 2 → 0\n   - Distance: 3 (5 to 2) + 3 (2 to 0) = 6\n\n2. **Path 2**: 5 → 2 → 4 → 0\n   - Distance: 3 (5 to 2) + 4 (2 to 4) + 1 (4 to 0) = 8 (not valid)\n\n3. **Path 3**: 5 → 2 → 1 → 3 → 0\n   - Distance: 3 (5 to 2) + 1 (2 to 1) + 2 (1 to 3) + 3 (3 to 0) = 9 (not valid)\n\n4. **Path 4**: 5 → 2 → 1 → 4 → 0\n   - Distance: 3 (5 to 2) + 1 (2 to 1) + 4 (1 to 4) + 1 (4 to 0) = 9 (not valid)\n\n5. **Path 5**: 5 → 2 → 3 → 0\n   - Distance: 3 (5 to 2) + 3 (2 to 3) + 3 (3 to 0) = 9 (not valid)\n\nAfter checking all combinations, we find that the only valid shortest path is:\n\n- **Path 1**: 5 → 2 → 0\n\n### Final Answer\nThus, the only shortest path from node 5 to node 0 is:\n\n{{[5, 2, 0]}}",

From node 6 (next closest):\n   - Distance to node 3: 1 (total distance = 1 + 2 = 3)\n   - Distance to node 4: 1 (total distance = 1 + 2 = 3)\n   - Distance to node 0: 4 (total distance = 1 + 4 = 5)\n   - Distance to node 1: 4 (total distance = 1 + 3 = 4)\n   - Distance to node 2: 5 (total distance = 1 + 4 = 5)\n   - Distance to node 7: 5 (total distance = 1 + 4 = 5)\n\n3.

The shortest distance from node 8 to node 1 is determined to be 7.\n\n### Step 3: Backtracking to Find All Paths\nNow we will find all paths from node 8 to node 1 that have a total weight of 7.\n\n1. **Path 1**: 8 → 5 → 1 (Weight: 1 + 4 = 5)\n2. **Path 2**: 8 → 5 → 2 → 1 (Weight: 1 + 4 + 1 = 6)\n3. **Path 3**: 8 → 5 → 2 → 6 → 1 (Weight: 1 + 4 + 3 + 3 = 11)\n4. **Path 4**: 8 → 3 → 1 (Weight: 3 + 3 = 6)\n5. **Path 5**: 8 → 3 → 4 → 1 (Weight: 3 + 2 + 2 = 7)\n\nAfter analyzing the paths, we find that the valid shortest paths from node 8 to node 1 with a total weight of 7 are:\n\n- Path 1: 8 → 5 → 1\n- Path 2: 8 → 3 → 4 → 1\n\n### Final Answer\nThus, the shortest paths from node 8 to node 1 are:\n\n{{[8, 5, 1], [8, 3, 4, 1]}}",

The shortest path distances from node 10 to all other nodes are calculated as follows:\n\n1. Start from node 10 with distance 0.\n2. Explore neighbors and update distances.\n3. Continue until all nodes are processed.\n\nAfter running Dijkstra's algorithm, we find the shortest distance from node 10 to node 3 is 8.\n\n### Step 3: Backtracking to Find All Shortest Paths\nNow we need to backtrack to find all paths that yield this shortest distance of 8. The paths can be constructed as follows:\n\n1. From node 10 to node 6 (weight 3).\n2. From node 6 to node 1 (weight 3).\n3. From node 1 to node 5 (weight 6).\n4. From node 5 to node 0 (weight 10).\n5. From node 0 to node 3 (weight 5).\n\nThe paths that yield the shortest distance of 8 are:\n\n1. **Path 1**: 10 → 6 → 1 → 5 → 0 → 3\n2. **Path 2**: 10 → 6 → 1 → 5 → 0 → 3 (this is the same as Path 1, as there are no alternative routes yielding the same distance).\n\n### Final Result\nThus, the shortest paths from node 10 to node 3 are:\n\n{{[10, 6, 1, 5, 0, 3]}}",

The shortest path from node 11 to node 1 can be found as follows:\n\n1. Start from node 11:\n   - Distance to node 0: 4 (via edge 11-0)\n   - Distance to node 2: 7 (via edge 11-2)\n   - Distance to node 6: 1 (via edge 11-6)\n\n2. From node 0 (distance 4):\n   - Distance to node 1: 7 (4 + 3 via edge 0-1)\n   - Distance to node 10: 6 (4 + 2 via edge 0-10)\n   - Distance to node 4: 12 (4 + 8 via edge 0-4)\n   - Distance to node 6: 10 (4 + 10 via edge 0-6)\n\n3. From node 6 (distance 1):\n   - Distance to node 7: 8 (1 + 7 via edge 6-7)\n   - Distance to node 11: 2 (1 + 1 via edge 6-11)\n   - Distance to node 10: 4 (1 + 3 via edge 6-10)\n\n4. From node 2 (distance 7):\n   - Distance to node 7: 12 (7 + 5 via edge 2-7)\n   - Distance to node 9: 8 (7 + 1 via edge 2-9)\n   - Distance to node 3: 11 (7 + 4 via edge 2-3)\n   - Distance to node 10: 12 (7 + 5 via edge 2-10)\n   - Distance to node 12: 10 (7 + 3 via edge 2-12)\n\n5. From node 10 (distance 6):\n   - Distance to node 1: 16 (6 + 10 via edge 10-1)\n   - Distance to node 12: 11 (6 + 5 via edge 10-12)\n   - Distance to node 3: 7 (6 + 1 via edge 10-3)\n   - Distance to node 5: 11 (6 + 5 via edge 10-5)\n   - Distance to node 4: 14 (6 + 8 via edge 10-4)\n   - Distance to node 6: 9 (6 + 3 via edge 10-6)\n   - Distance to node 7: 7 (6 + 1 via edge 10-7)\n   - Distance to node 8: 11 (6 + 5 via edge 10-8)\n\n### Step 3: Backtracking to Find All Shortest Paths\nThe shortest distance from node 11 to node 1 is 7. The paths that yield this distance are:\n\n1. **Path 1**: 11 → 0 → 1\n2. **Path 2**: 11 → 6 → 7 → 1\n\n### Final Answer\nThus, the shortest paths from node 11 to node 1 are:\n\n{{[11, 0, 1], [11, 6, 7, 1]}}",

Continue this process until all nodes are processed.\n\n### Step 3: Backtracking to Find All Shortest Paths\nOnce we have the shortest distance, we can backtrack to find all paths that yield that distance.\n\nAfter running the algorithm, we find that the shortest distance from node 13 to node 5 is 10. The possible paths that yield this distance are:\n\n1. **Path 1**: 13 → 3 → 1 → 0 → 5\n2. **Path 2**: 13 → 3 → 1 → 0 → 8 → 12 → 10 → 5\n\n### Final Result\nThe shortest paths from node 13 to node 5 are:\n\n{{[13, 3, 1, 0, 5], [13, 3, 1, 0, 8, 12, 10, 5]}}",

The shortest path from node 9 to node 3 can be found as follows:\n\n1. Start from node 9, the initial distance is 0.\n2. Explore neighbors of node 9: \n   - To node 8 with weight 4 (total distance = 4)\n   - To node 10 with weight 7 (total distance = 7)\n3. From node 8, explore its neighbors:\n   - To node 0 with weight 8 (total distance = 12)\n   - To node 11 with weight 6 (total distance = 10)\n   - To node 9 (already visited)\n4. From node 10, explore its neighbors:\n   - To node 4 with weight 4 (total distance = 11)\n   - To node 9 (already visited)\n5. Continue exploring until all nodes are visited.\n\nAfter running Dijkstra's algorithm, we find the shortest distance from node 9 to node 3 is 17.\n\n### Step 3: Backtracking to Find All Shortest Paths\nNow we need to backtrack to find all paths that yield this shortest distance. The paths can be constructed as follows:\n\n1. From node 9 to node 8 to node 11 to node 1 to node 2 to node 4 to node 10 to node 3.\n2. From node 9 to node 8 to node 11 to node 1 to node 4 to node 3.\n3. From node 9 to node 10 to node 4 to node 1 to node 2 to node 3.\n4. From node 9 to node 10 to node 4 to node 1 to node 3.\n\n### Final Result\nThe shortest paths from node 9 to node 3 are:\n\n{{[9, 8, 11, 1, 2, 4, 10, 3], [9, 8, 11, 1, 4, 3], [9, 10, 4, 1, 2, 3], [9, 10, 4, 1, 3]}}",

Start from node 7, the only edge is to node 3 with weight 7.\n2. From node 3, we can reach:\n   - Node 10 (7 + 9 = 16)\n   - Node 11 (7 + 7 = 14)\n   - Node 6 (7 + 1 = 8)\n3. From node 6, we can reach node 11 (8 + 4 = 12).\n4. From node 11, we can reach node 1 (14 + 3 = 17) and node 12 (14 + 2 = 16).\n\nThe shortest distance from node 7 to node 12 is 16.\n\n### Step 3: Backtrack to Find All Paths\nNow we will find all paths that yield this shortest distance of 16:\n\n1. **Path 1**: 7 → 3 → 11 → 1 → 12\n   - We can take the edge from 7 to 3 (7), then from 3 to 11 (7), from 11 to 1 (3), and finally from 1 to 12 (2).\n   - Total weight: 7 + 7 + 3 + 2 = 19 (not valid)\n\n2. **Path 2**: 7 → 3 → 11 → 12\n   - From 7 to 3 (7), then from 3 to 11 (7), and from 11 to 12 (2).\n   - Total weight: 7 + 7 + 2 = 16 (valid)\n\n3. **Path 3**: 7 → 3 → 6 → 11 → 12\n   - From 7 to 3 (7), then from 3 to 6 (1), from 6 to 11 (4), and from 11 to 12 (2).\n   - Total weight: 7 + 1 + 4 + 2 = 14 (not valid)\n\nAfter checking all possible paths, we find that the only valid shortest path from node 7 to node 12 is:\n\n- **Path**: 7 → 3 → 11 → 12\n\n### Final Answer\nThus, the shortest paths from node 7 to node 12 are:\n\n{{[7, 3, 11, 12]}}",

The relevant edges from node 8 are:\n\n- (8, 9) with weight 6\n\nFrom node 9, we can reach node 10 and node 15, and from node 10, we can reach node 12.\n\n### Step 2: Paths Exploration\n\n1. **Path from 8 to 9**: \n   - Distance = 6\n\n2. **From 9 to 10**: \n   - Distance = 3 (Total = 6 + 3 = 9)\n\n3. **From 10 to 12**: \n   - Distance = 3 (Total = 9 + 3 = 12)\n\nThus, one path is: **8 → 9 → 10 → 12** with a total distance of 12.\n\n4. **From 9 to 15**: \n   - Distance = 8 (Total = 6 + 8 = 14)\n\nFrom node 15, we can reach node 12 with a distance of 4 (Total = 14 + 4 = 18), which is longer than the previous path.\n\n### Step 3: Backtracking for All Paths\n\nNow we will check if there are any other paths that yield the same shortest distance of 12:\n\n1. **Path 1**: 8 → 9 → 10 → 12 (Distance = 12)\n\nNo other paths from node 8 to node 12 yield a distance of 12.\n\n### Final Result\n\nThe only shortest path from node 8 to node 12 is:\n\n{{[8, 9, 10, 12]}}\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\nA: {{[8, 9, 10, 12]}}",

The shortest path distance is calculated as follows:\n\n1. From node 4 to node 15 (1)\n2. From node 15 to node 10 (4)\n3. From node 10 to node 19 (8)\n4. Total distance = 1 + 4 + 8 = 13\n\n### Step 3: Path Reconstruction\nNow we will find all paths that yield this shortest distance of 13.\n\n1. **Path 1**: 4 → 15 → 10 → 19\n2. **Path 2**: 4 → 15 → 12 → 18 → 19 (since 12 to 18 is 1 and 18 to 19 is 4)\n3. **Path 3**: 4 → 15 → 12 → 17 → 19 (since 12 to 17 is 5 and 17 to 19 is 4)\n\nAfter checking all possible routes, we find that the paths yielding the shortest distance of 13 are:\n\n- 4 → 15 → 10 → 19\n- 4 → 15 → 12 → 18 → 19\n- 4 → 15 → 12 → 17 → 19\n\n### Final Answer\nThus, the shortest paths from node 4 to node 19 are:\n\n{{[4, 15, 10, 19], [4, 15, 12, 18, 19], [4, 15, 12, 17, 19]}}",
