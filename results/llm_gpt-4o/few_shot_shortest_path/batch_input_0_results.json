The shortest path is the one with the least total weight, which is 3.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from node 3 to node 0 is:\n\n{{[3, 2, 0]}}",

The goal is to find the path(s) with the minimum total weight.\n\nGiven the edges and their weights, let's calculate the shortest paths:\n\n- From node 9, the possible direct connections are to nodes 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7.\n- The shortest path from node 9 to node 0 is through node 1, as it has the smallest cumulative weight.\n\nThe shortest path from node 9 to node 0 is:\n- 9 -> 1 -> 0 with a total weight of 1 (9 to 1) + 4 (1 to 0) = 5.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from node 9 to node 0 is:\n\n{{[9, 1, 0]}}",

From node 9, you can reach:\n   - Node 0 with weight 1\n   - Node 1 with weight 3\n   - Node 2 with weight 4\n   - Node 4 with weight 1\n   - Node 6 with weight 3\n   - Node 7 with weight 3\n   - Node 8 with weight 3\n\nNow, let's find the shortest paths:\n\n- Path 1: 5 -> 7 -> 9\n  - 5 to 7 has a weight of 1\n  - 7 to 9 has a weight of 3\n  - Total weight = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- Path 2: 5 -> 6 -> 9\n  - 5 to 6 has a weight of 2\n  - 6 to 9 has a weight of 3\n  - Total weight = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- Path 3: 5 -> 4 -> 9\n  - 5 to 4 has a weight of 4\n  - 4 to 9 has a weight of 1\n  - Total weight = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nThe shortest path is Path 1 with a total weight of 4. Therefore, the shortest paths from node 5 to node 9 are:\n\n{{[5, 7, 9]}}",

Let's break down the connections:\n\n1. Node 10 is connected to node 8 with weight 8.\n2. Node 8 is connected to node 9 with weight 3.\n3. Node 9 is connected to node 0 with weight 10.\n4. Node 0 is connected to node 2 with weight 3, node 3 with weight 9, node 5 with weight 7, node 9 with weight 10, and node 11 with weight 7.\n5. Node 4 is connected to node 6 with weight 3 and node 11 with weight 8.\n6. Node 6 is connected to node 7 with weight 8.\n7. Node 3 is connected to node 5 with weight 2.\n8. Node 5 is connected to node 11 with weight 8.\n9. Node 1 is connected to node 11 with weight 10.\n\nTo find the shortest path from node 10 to node 6, we can trace the path:\n\n- Start at node 10, go to node 8 (weight 8).\n- From node 8, go to node 9 (weight 3).\n- From node 9, go to node 0 (weight 10).\n- From node 0, go to node 5 (weight 7).\n- From node 5, go to node 3 (weight 2).\n- From node 3, go to node 0 (weight 9).\n- From node 0, go to node 11 (weight 7).\n- From node 11, go to node 4 (weight 8).\n- From node 4, go to node 6 (weight 3).\n\nThe total weight of this path is 8 + 3 + 10 + 7 + 2 + 9 + 7 + 8 + 3 = 57.\n\nHowever, this path is not optimal. Let's find a more optimal path:\n\n- Start at node 10, go to node 8 (weight 8).\n- From node 8, go to node 9 (weight 3).\n- From node 9, go to node 0 (weight 10).\n- From node 0, go to node 5 (weight 7).\n- From node 5, go to node 11 (weight 8).\n- From node 11, go to node 4 (weight 8).\n- From node 4, go to node 6 (weight 3).\n\nThe total weight of this path is 8 + 3 + 10 + 7 + 8 + 8 + 3 = 47.\n\nThis is the shortest path from node 10 to node 6. Therefore, the shortest path is:\n\n{{[10, 8, 9, 0, 5, 11, 4, 6]}}",

Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Identify Connections**: \n   - Node 7 is connected to node 6 with weight 9.\n   - Node 6 is connected to node 3 with weight 4 and node 8 with weight 3.\n   - Node 8 is connected to node 4 with weight 7, node 11 with weight 10, and node 13 with weight 2.\n   - Node 13 is connected to node 0 with weight 3.\n   - Node 0 is connected to node 5 with weight 10 and node 13 with weight 3.\n   - Node 5 is connected to node 3 with weight 7 and node 10 with weight 7.\n   - Node 3 is connected to node 6 with weight 4, node 5 with weight 7, node 10 with weight 7, and node 11 with weight 10.\n   - Node 11 is connected to node 9 with weight 9 and node 15 with weight 3.\n   - Node 9 is connected to node 2 with weight 2.\n   - Node 2 is connected to node 1 with weight 5 and node 14 with weight 9.\n   - Node 14 is connected to node 15 with weight 5.\n   - Node 15 is connected to node 4 with weight 5 and node 11 with weight 3.\n   - Node 4 is connected to node 8 with weight 7 and node 12 with weight 5.\n   - Node 12 is connected to node 13 with weight 9.\n\n2. **Find Shortest Path**:\n   - Starting from node 7, the path to node 1 can be found by traversing through the graph and calculating the cumulative weights.\n   - The shortest path from node 7 to node 1 is: 7 → 6 → 8 → 13 → 0 → 5 → 3 → 10 → 11 → 9 → 2 → 1.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Weight**:\n   - The total weight for this path is 9 (7 to 6) + 3 (6 to 8) + 2 (8 to 13) + 3 (13 to 0) + 10 (0 to 5) + 7 (5 to 3) + 7 (3 to 10) + 5 (10 to 11) + 9 (11 to 9) + 2 (9 to 2) + 5 (2 to 1) = 62.\n\n4. **Verify for Other Possible Shortest Paths**:\n   - After checking other possible paths, it appears that this is the only path with the minimum weight.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from node 7 to node 1 is:\n\n{{[7, 6, 8, 13, 0, 5, 3, 10, 11, 9, 2, 1]}}",

Total weight = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n- From node 12 to node 14 (weight 6), then from node 14 to node 5 (weight 2). Total weight = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nThe shortest path is the one with the least total weight, which is 4. Therefore, the shortest path is:\n\n{{[12, 2, 5]}}",

Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Identify the shortest path from node 1 to node 15:**\n   - Start from node 1.\n   - The shortest path from node 1 to node 15 involves reaching node 15 with the least total weight.\n\n2. **Calculate the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm or a similar method:**\n   - From node 1, the direct connection is to node 17 with weight 1.\n   - From node 17, the shortest path to node 11 is with weight 3.\n   - From node 11, the shortest path to node 18 is with weight 1.\n   - From node 18, the shortest path to node 5 is with weight 1.\n   - From node 5, the shortest path to node 14 is with weight 5.\n   - From node 14, the shortest path to node 3 is with weight 8.\n   - From node 3, the shortest path to node 7 is with weight 2.\n   - From node 7, the shortest path to node 0 is with weight 5.\n   - From node 0, the shortest path to node 5 is with weight 1.\n   - From node 5, the shortest path to node 8 is with weight 1.\n   - From node 8, the shortest path to node 13 is with weight 8.\n   - From node 13, the shortest path to node 10 is with weight 10.\n   - From node 10, the shortest path to node 16 is with weight 6.\n   - From node 16, the shortest path to node 15 is with weight 1.\n\n3. **Compile the shortest path:**\n   - The shortest path from node 1 to node 15 is: [1, 17, 11, 18, 5, 14, 3, 7, 0, 5, 8, 13, 10, 16, 15].\n\n4. **Verify if there are alternative paths with the same total weight:**\n   - In this case, the path [1, 17, 11, 18, 5, 14, 3, 7, 0, 5, 8, 13, 10, 16, 15] is the only path with the minimum weight.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from node 1 to node 15 is:\n\n{{[1, 17, 11, 18, 5, 14, 3, 7, 0, 5, 8, 13, 10, 16, 15]}}",

Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Connections**: Start from node 12 and explore the connections:\n   - Node 12 is connected to node 8 with weight 2.\n   - Node 8 is connected to node 6 with weight 2, node 9 with weight 1, node 12 with weight 2, and node 14 with weight 2.\n   - Node 9 is connected to node 2 with weight 4, node 8 with weight 1, node 11 with weight 5, and node 16 with weight 6.\n   - Node 11 is connected to node 0 with weight 5, node 2 with weight 9, node 6 with weight 8, and node 9 with weight 5.\n   - Node 0 is connected to node 4 with weight 7 and node 11 with weight 5.\n\n2. **Calculate Path Weights**: Calculate the total weight for each potential path from node 12 to node 4:\n   - Path 1: 12 → 8 → 9 → 11 → 0 → 4\n     - Total weight = 2 (12 to 8) + 1 (8 to 9) + 5 (9 to 11) + 5 (11 to 0) + 7 (0 to 4) = 20\n   - Path 2: 12 → 8 → 9 → 11 → 0 → 4\n     - Total weight = 2 (12 to 8) + 1 (8 to 9) + 5 (9 to 11) + 5 (11 to 0) + 7 (0 to 4) = 20\n\n3. **Identify Shortest Paths**: Both paths have the same total weight, so they are both shortest paths.\n\nThus, the shortest paths from node 12 to node 4 are:\n\n{{[12, 8, 9, 11, 0, 4]}}",
